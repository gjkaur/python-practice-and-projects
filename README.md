## Number Guessing Game in Python (number_guessing_game.py)

This is a simple terminal-based Number Guessing Game built with Python 3. The user defines a number range, and the program randomly selects a number within that range. The user is then given 7 attempts to guess the correct number, receiving feedback after each attempt.

1. The user enters the **lower** and **upper bounds** for the guessing range.
2. A random number is generated within that range.
3. The user has **7 chances** to guess the number.
4. After each guess, the game provides feedback:
   - Too high
   - Too low
   - Correct
5. If the user guesses correctly within 7 attempts, they win.
6. If they run out of attempts, the correct number is revealed.

## Word Guessing Game in Python (word_guessing_game.py)

A simple terminal-based word guessing game written in Python. The user tries to guess the letters of a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts.


1. The user is greeted and asked to enter their name.
2. A random word is selected from a predefined list.
3. The user has **12 chances** to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time.
4. After each guess, the program shows the partially completed word with correct guesses revealed.
5. If the user guesses all letters before running out of attempts, they win.
6. If they run out of attempts, the correct word is revealed and the game ends.
