## Number Guessing Game in Python (number_guessing_game.py)

This is a simple terminal-based Number Guessing Game built with Python 3. The user defines a number range, and the program randomly selects a number within that range. The user is then given 7 attempts to guess the correct number, receiving feedback after each attempt.

1. The user enters the **lower** and **upper bounds** for the guessing range.
2. A random number is generated within that range.
3. The user has **7 chances** to guess the number.
4. After each guess, the game provides feedback:
   - Too high
   - Too low
   - Correct
5. If the user guesses correctly within 7 attempts, they win.
6. If they run out of attempts, the correct number is revealed.
